//function is a set of instructions that perform a task.
//method is also a set of instructions that performs a perticular task.
//but function is an object in js.every function has a prototype property.prototype is basically also an object. object is a collection of key and value; if the value are primitive(number,string,boolean) or another object;the value and key is considered as a property; if the the value is a function,it is called method.method are accosiated with an object.

//Example to define the method
//go in the browser ;declare an array and then console.dir it.
// const a = [];
// console.dir(a);
//
// const b = new Array(0, 1); and const b=[0,1] is same;
// console.log(b);
//so array is created from new keyword and Array() function.
//so Array() is a function and it has a property which is prototype.
//prototype is also an object and it has many properties.in that we will found keys and values;and the values is a function.so this properties is called method.as like as indexof(),find(),map(),includes(),etc.so that is why we call these an array method.
